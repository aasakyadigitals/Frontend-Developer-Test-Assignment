# Frontend-Developer-Test-Assignment

## Project Overview 

Create a responsive web application for a fictional e-commerce store called "Tech Haven." The application should allow users to browse products, view product details, add products to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. 

## Requirements 

** Home Page: Display a list of products with basic details (image, name, price). 

** Product Details Page: Show detailed information about a selected product (image, name, price, description, and reviews). 

** Shopping Cart: Allow users to add/remove products, view the total price, and proceed to checkout. 

** Checkout Page: Collect user information (name, address, payment details) and display a summary of the order. 

** Responsive Design: Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). 

** Navigation: Implement a navigation bar to switch between different pages. 

** State Management: Use a state management library (e.g., Redux) to manage the application state. 

** API Integration: Fetch product data from a mock API (you can use JSON Placeholder or create your own mock data). 

** Form Validation: Implement form validation for the checkout page. 

** Testing: Write unit tests for key components using a testing library (e.g., Jest).
